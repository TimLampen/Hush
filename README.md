## Hush is a personal receptionist for your phone.
Hush detects when a notification you receive is not relevant to you in the moment. It can then hide it or silence it so you may deal with it later. You can tell Hush exactly how to filter the notifications you receive, or simply let it learn from the way you interact with them. Your choice!
### No more distractions
Hush ensures that you are compelled to look at your phone only when it is relevant by differentiating important notifications from stuff that can wait.
### No more clutter
Stop missing important messages in clutter. Hush keeps whatâ€™s important at the top of your notification centre and regroups what is less urgent lower.
### Simple but powerful settings
Over time, Hush learns which notifications are important to you and when you would want to receive them. Customize this yourself or let the AI do it!
